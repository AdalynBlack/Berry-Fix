# Berry Fix
This small, simple mod fixes a mild annoyance of mine, wherein right clicking with edible items that also function as blocks, such as sweet berries, it can be very easy to accidentally place them down instead of eating them. This mod allows you to always eat berries and similar blocks if you have the hunger to eat them in the first place, allowing them to be placed only if you're at full hunger, or are holding the override key (Left Alt by default). In Creative mode, the berries maintain their vanilla behavior
